# Ad-view

Ad-view is a lightweight tool which was built to enable us to quickly view adverts posted across the core RBS recruitment websites.

It features a front-end build using Angular CLI and an Express powered backend to 'scrape' adverts from the websites (with help from [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio)).

## Development server and API

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server and supporting API (located at `http://localhost:8080`). Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
